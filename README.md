# BandwidthMinimization

The bandwidth problem takes as input a graph G, with n vertices and m edges (ie. pairs of vertices). The goal is to find a permutation of the vertices on the line which minimizes the maximum length of any edge. This is better understood through an example. Suppose G consists of 5 vertices and the edges (v1, v2), (v1,v3), (v1,v4), and (v1,v5). We must map each vertex to a distinct number between 1 and n. Under the mapping vi → i, the last edge spans a distance of four (ie. 5-1). However, the permutation {2, 3, 1, 4, 5} is better, for none of the edges spans a distance of more than two. In fact, it is a permutation which minimizes the maximum length of the edges in G, as is any permutation where 1 is in the center.
  
The bandwidth problem has a variety of applications, including optimizing memory usage in hypertext documents. What is known about it? The problem is NP-complete, meaning that it is exceedingly unlikely that you will be able to find an algorithm with polynomial worst-case running time. It remains NP-complete even for restricted classes of trees. However, since the goal of the problem is to find a permutation, a backtracking program which iterates through all the n! possible permutations and computes the length of the longest edge for each gives an easy O(n! · m) algorithm. But the goal of this assignment is to find as practically good an algorithm as possible.
